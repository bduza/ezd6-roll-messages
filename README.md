me, muddling my way through getting this older module to work in v11
This was forked from Xaukael, who has done 100% of the work
However, due to not wanting to maintain macros across foundry versions Xaukael's version 1.3.0 has dropped the macros and also the styling being done to the sheets.
As I like the styling and I think the macros are currently working, for the time being I'm keeping this older fork alive for my personal use and I don't know enough about Foundry modules - hopefully this hasn't been listed anywhere or something. Xaukael's is the main and newest version, use that one!
